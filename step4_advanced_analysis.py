        Azure AI Language Service is a cloud-based service that provides Natural Language Processing (NLP) 
        features for understanding and analyzing text. The service offers a comprehensive suite of 
        capabilities including sentiment analysis, key phrase extraction, language detection, and named 
        entity recognition.
        
        Sentiment analysis helps developers understand the emotional tone of text, which is valuable for 
        analyzing customer feedback, social media posts, and reviews. The service can detect positive, 
        negative, or neutral sentiment with confidence scores.
        
        Key phrase extraction identifies the main talking points in text, helping to quickly understand 
        the key themes and topics. This is particularly useful for document summarization and content 
        categorization.
        
        Language detection can identify the language of text from over 120 supported languages, making 
        it ideal for processing multilingual content and routing text to appropriate language-specific 
        processing pipelines.
        
        Named entity recognition identifies and categorizes entities such as people, organizations, 
        locations, dates, and more. This capability is essential for information extraction and 
        knowledge management applications.
        
        The service also includes personally identifiable information (PII) detection to help protect 
        sensitive data and ensure compliance with privacy regulations. All these features are available 
        through simple REST APIs and SDKs for popular programming languages.
